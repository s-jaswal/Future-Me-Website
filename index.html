                <p>
                    <span class="first-character sc">T</span>he tech CEO needs to impress customers with their
                    understanding of customer problems and be able to provide a technical solution that is capable of
                    solving these issues. Importantly, they need to be able to do it alone without backup, such as the
                    CTO or other engineering people.

                    What I mean by a “tech CEO” is not necessarily someone who is a deep expert in the particular field
                    the startup's solution is based on, but they do need to be highly trained in a field of science or
                    engineering that enables them to understand how the technology works well enough that they can hold
                    their own in conversations with customers who are themselves technically adept.

                    It's not just interactions with customers that matter, either. It's also about being able to make
                    well-informed decisions that affect the technical product from a business perspective and to have
                    productive discussions with the engineering team about implementing such decisions. Since so much
                    rides on the engineering team in a deep tech startup, and it's vitally important that the technology
                    is aligned with the business strategy, the relationship between the CEO and the engineering team
                    must be built on strong mutual respect.

                    <li class="pretty-font">Responsibilities as a Tech CEO: Setting the company's vision and mission: Articulating the
                        company's purpose and ensuring that all employees are aligned with its goals and values.
                        Building and leading a talented team: A successful startup CEO must be able to attract, retain,
                        and motivate top talent.
                        → This requires the CEO to be a strong leader and communicator who can build trust and inspire
                        others to achieve great things.

                    <li class="pretty-font">Work Environment: What are the chief executives actually doing with their day?
                        The study found that a CEO's work is diverse: 25 percent of their work is spent on people and
                        relationships, 25 percent on functional and business unit reviews, 16 percent on organization
                        and culture, and 21 percent on strategy. Only 3 percent of their work is spent on professional
                        development, and only 1 percent on crisis management. Meanwhile, 4 percent of their work is on
                        mergers and acquisitions, while another 4 percent is spent on operating plans.
                        And even CEOs are plagued by not-so-efficient meetings.
                        Meetings make up a big bulk of a CEO's day too; 72 percent of their work time is spent in
                        meetings, compared to 28 percent alone time. Thirty-two percent of the CEOs' meetings lasted an
                        hour, 38 percent were longer than that and 30 percent were shorter.
                        “In our debriefs, CEOs confessed that one-hour meetings could often be cut to 30 or even 15
                        minutes,” Porter and Nohria wrote in Harvard Business Review.
                        The study also found CEOs value face-time: 61 percent of their communication was face-to-face,
                        while only 24 percent was electronic (like email), and 15 percent by phone and letter.

                    </li>

                    <li class="pretty-font">Our Impact on Society: Today's challenges, from the pandemic to ESG to ongoing efforts to
                        address racial inequity, have only woven business and society more tightly together. Indeed, 86%
                        of CEOs and board members see business and society becoming more interconnected, and two thirds
                        of the American public want CEOs to take a stand on social issues.
