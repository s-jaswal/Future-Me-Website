                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The tech CEO needs to impress customers with their understanding of customer problems and be
                            able to provide a technical solution that is capable of solving these issues. Importantly,
                            they need to be able to do it alone without backup, such as the CTO or other engineering
                            people.

                        <h2>Social Experiment</h2>
                        <p>What I mean by a “tech CEO” is not necessarily someone who is a deep expert in the particular
                            field the startup's solution is based on, but they do need to be highly trained in a field
                            of science or engineering that enables them to understand how the technology works well
                            enough that they can hold their own in conversations with customers who are themselves
                            technically adept.

                        <h2>Tech + Leadership</h2>
                        <p>It's not just interactions with customers that matter, either. It's also about being able to
                            make well-informed decisions that affect the technical product from a business perspective
                            and to have productive discussions with the engineering team about implementing such
                            decisions. Since so much rides on the engineering team in a deep tech startup, and it's
                            vitally important that the technology is aligned with the business strategy, the
                            relationship between the CEO and the engineering team must be built on strong mutual
                            respect.

                        <p>The core of the MathJax project is the development of its state-of-the-art, open source,
                            JavaScript platform for display of mathematics. Our key design goals are</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>high-quality display of mathematics notation in all browsers</li>
                            <li>no special browser setup required</li>
                            <li>support for LaTeX, MathML and other equation markup directly in the HTML source.</li>
                            <li>an extensible, modular design with a rich API for easy integration into web
                                applications.</li>
                            <li>support for accessibility, copy and paste and other rich functionality</li>
                            <li>interoperability with other applications and math-aware search.</li>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>
                            MathJax grew out of the popular <a href="http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/">jsMath</a>
                            project, an earlier Ajax-based math rendering system developed by Davide Cervone in 2004. In
                            the following years, there were many significant developments
                            relevant for web publication of mathematics: consolidation of browser support for CSS 2.1,
                            Web Font technology, adoption of math accessibility standards, and increasing usage of XML
                            workflows for scientific publication.</p>
                        <p>In 2009, AMS, Design Science, and SIAM formed the MathJax Consortium to enable Cervone and
                            others to design MathJax from the ground up as a next-generation platform, while still
                            benefiting from the extensive real-world experience gained from
                            jsMath. Since its initial release in 2010, MathJax has become the gold standard for
                            mathematics on the web.</p>
